During my Bachelor's degree I fell in love with web and mobile development, and my efforts in this field were rewarded by finding a part-time job as a full-stack Agile web developer that I carried on during my studies. On my Master's degree I deepened topics about machine learning, privacy, cryptography and blockchain, with which I am doing my thesis.",
